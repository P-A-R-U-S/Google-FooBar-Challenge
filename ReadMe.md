## Level 1

##### Minion Labor Shifts

Commander Lambda’s minions are upset! They’re given the worst jobs on the whole space station, and some of them are starting to complain that even those worst jobs are being allocated unfairly. If you can fix this problem, it’ll prove your chops to Commander Lambda so you can get promoted!

Minions’ tasks are assigned by putting their ID numbers into a list, one time for each day they’ll work that task. As shifts are planned well in advance, the lists for each task will contain up to 99 integers. When a minion is scheduled for the same task too many times, they’ll complain about it until they’re taken off the task completely. Some tasks are worse than others, so the number of scheduled assignments before a minion will refuse to do a task varies depending on the task. You figure you can speed things up by automating the removal of the minions who have been assigned a task too many times before they even get a chance to start complaining.

Write a function called answer(data, n) that takes in a list of less than 100 integers and a number n, and returns that same list but with all of the numbers that occur more than n times removed entirely. The returned list should retain the same ordering as the original list — you don’t want to mix up those carefully-planned shift rotations! For instance, if data was [5, 10, 15, 10, 7] and n was 1, answer(data, n) would return the list [5, 15, 7] because 10 occurs twice, and thus was removed from the list entirely.

##### Prison Labor Dodgers

Commander Lambda is all about efficiency, including using her bunny prisoners for manual labor. But no one's been properly monitoring the labor shifts for a while, and they've gotten quite mixed up. You've been given the task of fixing them, but after you wrote up new shifts, you realized that some prisoners had been transferred to a different block and aren't available for their assigned shifts. And manually sorting through each shift list to compare against prisoner block lists will take forever - remember, Commander Lambda loves efficiency!

Given two almost identical lists of prisoner IDs x and y where one of the lists contains an additional ID, write a function answer(x, y) that compares the lists and returns the additional ID.

For example, given the lists x = [13, 5, 6, 2, 5] and y = [5, 2, 5, 13], the function answer(x, y) would return 6 because the list x contains the integer 6 and the list y doesn't. Given the lists x = [14, 27, 1, 4, 2, 50, 3, 1] and y = [2, 4, -4, 3, 1, 1, 14, 27, 50], the function answer(x, y) would return -4 because the list y contains the integer -4 and the list x doesn't.

In each test case, the lists x and y will always contain n non-unique integers where n is at least 1 but never more than 99, and one of the lists will contain an additional unique integer which should be returned by the function.  The same n non-unique integers will be present on both lists, but they might appear in a different order, like in the examples above. Commander Lambda likes to keep her numbers short, so every prisoner ID will be between -1000 and 1000.

##### The cake is not a lie!

Commander Lambda has had an incredibly successful week: she completed the first test run of her LAMBCHOP doomsday device, she captured six key members of the Bunny Rebellion, and she beat her personal high score in Tetris. To celebrate, she’s ordered cake for everyone – even the lowliest of minions! But competition among minions is fierce, and if you don’t cut exactly equal slices of cake for everyone, you’ll get in big trouble.

The cake is round, and decorated with M&Ms in a circle around the edge. But while the rest of the cake is uniform, the M&Ms are not: there are multiple colors, and every minion must get exactly the same sequence of M&Ms. Commander Lambda hates waste and will not tolerate any leftovers, so you also want to make sure you can serve the entire cake.

To help you best cut the cake, you have turned the sequence of colors of the M&Ms on the cake into a string: each possible letter (between a and z) corresponds to a unique color, and the sequence of M&Ms is given clockwise (the decorations form a circle around the outer edge of the cake).

Write a function called answer(s) that, given a non-empty string less than 200 characters in length describing the sequence of M&Ms, returns the maximum number of equal parts that can be cut from the cake without leaving any leftovers.

## Level 2

##### En Route Salute

Commander Lambda loves efficiency and hates anything that wastes time. She's a busy lamb, after all! She generously rewards henchmen who identify sources of inefficiency and come up with ways to remove them. You've spotted one such source, and you think solving it will help you build the reputation you need to get promoted.

Every time the Commander's employees pass each other in the hall, each of them must stop and salute each other - one at a time - before resuming their path. A salute is five seconds long, so each exchange of salutes takes a full ten seconds (Commander Lambda's salute is a bit, er, involved). You think that by removing the salute requirement, you could save several collective hours of employee time per day. But first, you need to show her how bad the problem really is.

Write a program that counts how many salutes are exchanged during a typical walk along a hallway. The hall is represented by a string. For example: "--->-><-><-->-"

Each hallway string will contain three different types of characters: '>', an employee walking to the right; '<', an employee walking to the left; and '-', an empty space. Every employee walks at the same speed either to right or to the left, according to their direction. Whenever two employees cross, each of them salutes the other. They then continue walking until they reach the end, finally leaving the hallway. In the above example, they salute 10 times.

Write a function answer(s) which takes a string representing employees walking along a hallway and returns the number of times the employees will salute. s will contain at least 1 and at most 100 characters, each one of -, >, or <

##### Power Hungry

Commander Lambda’s space station is HUGE. And huge space stations take a LOT of power. Huge space stations with doomsday devices take even more power. To help meet the station’s power needs, Commander Lambda has installed solar panels on the station’s outer surface. But the station sits in the middle of a quasar quantum flux field, which wreaks havoc on the solar panels. You and your team of henchmen has been assigned to repair the solar panels, but you can’t take them all down at once without shutting down the space station (and all those pesky life support systems!).

You need to figure out which sets of panels in any given array you can take offline to repair while still maintaining the maximum amount of power output per array, and to do THAT, you’ll first need to figure out what the maximum output of each array actually is. Write a function answer(xs) that takes a list of integers representing the power output levels of each panel in an array, and returns the maximum product of some non-empty subset of those numbers. So for example, if an array contained panels with power output levels of [2, -3, 1, 0, -5], then the maximum product would be found by taking the subset: xs[0] = 2, xs[1] = -3, xs[4] = -5, giving the product 2*(-3)*(-5) = 30. So answer([2,-3,1,0,-5]) will be “30”.

Each array of solar panels contains at least 1 and no more than 50 panels, and each panel will have a power output level whose absolute value is no greater than 1000 (some panels are malfunctioning so badly that they’re draining energy, but you know a trick with the panels’ wave stabilizer that lets you combine two negative-output panels to produce the positive output of the multiple of their power values). The final products may be very large, so give the answer as a string representation of the number.

## Level 3

##### Queue To Do

You're almost ready to make your move to destroy the LAMBCHOP doomsday device, but the security checkpoints that guard the underlying systems of the LAMBCHOP are going to be a problem. You were able to take one down without tripping any alarms, which is great! Except that as Commander Lambda's assistant, you've learned that the checkpoints are about to come under automated review, which means that your sabotage will be discovered and your cover blown - unless you can trick the automated review system.

To trick the system, you'll need to write a program to return the same security checksum that the guards would have after they would have checked all the workers through. Fortunately, Commander Lambda's desire for efficiency won't allow for hours-long lines, so the checkpoint guards have found ways to quicken the pass-through rate. Instead of checking each and every worker coming through, the guards instead go over everyone in line while noting their security IDs, then allow the line to fill back up. Once they've done that they go over the line again, this time leaving off the last worker. They continue doing this, leaving off one more worker from the line each time but recording the security IDs of those they do check, until they skip the entire line, at which point they XOR the IDs of all the workers they noted into a checksum and then take off for lunch. Fortunately, the workers' orderly nature causes them to always line up in numerical order without any gaps.

For example, if the first worker in line has ID 0 and the security checkpoint line holds three workers, the process would look like this:

0 1 2 /
3 4 / 5
6 / 7 8
where the guards' XOR (^) checksum is 0^1^2^3^4^6 == 2.

Likewise, if the first worker has ID 17 and the checkpoint holds four workers, the process would look like:

17 18 19 20 /
21 22 23 / 24
25 26 / 27 28
29 / 30 31 32
which produces the checksum 17^18^19^20^21^22^23^25^26^29 == 14.

All worker IDs (including the first worker) are between 0 and 2000000000 inclusive, and the checkpoint line will always be at least 1 worker long.

With this information, write a function answer(start, length) that will cover for the missing security checkpoint by outputting the same checksum the guards would normally submit before lunch. You have just enough time to find out the ID of the first worker to be checked (start) and the length of the line (length) before the automatic review occurs, so your program must generate the proper checksum with just those two values.

##### Prepare the Bunnies' Escape

You're awfully close to destroying the LAMBCHOP doomsday device and freeing Commander Lambda's bunny prisoners, but once they're free of the prison blocks, the bunnies are going to need to escape Lambda's space station via the escape pods as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the halls of the space station are a maze of corridors and dead ends that will be a deathtrap for the escaping bunnies. Fortunately, Commander Lambda has put you in charge of a remodeling project that will give you the opportunity to make things a little easier for the bunnies. Unfortunately (again), you can't just remove all obstacles between the bunnies and the escape pods - at most you can remove one wall per escape pod path, both to maintain structural integrity of the station and to avoid arousing Commander Lambda's suspicions.

You have maps of parts of the space station, each starting at a prison exit and ending at the door to an escape pod. The map is represented as a matrix of 0s and 1s, where 0s are passable space and 1s are impassable walls. The door out of the prison is at the top left (0,0) and the door into an escape pod is at the bottom right (w-1,h-1).

Write a function answer(map) that generates the length of the shortest path from the prison door to the escape pod, where you are allowed to remove one wall as part of your remodeling plans. The path length is the total number of nodes you pass through, counting both the entrance and exit nodes. The starting and ending positions are always passable (0). The map will always be solvable, though you may or may not need to remove a wall. The height and width of the map can be from 2 to 20. Moves can only be made in cardinal directions; no diagonal moves are allowed.
